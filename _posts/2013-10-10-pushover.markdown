About 2 month ago, I found a nice service going by the name of pushover.net.

~~~
"Pushover makes it easy to send real-time notifications to your Android and iOS devices."
~~~

I had a look around for a decent PHP library, but could not find one. Most of them either had way too much code for such a simple task (it's basically a curl call), or where totally untested.

The library I built is very easy to use, and easy to setup. Below you can see an example of how to send a push notification:

~~~
include __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$pushover = new \Scottymeuk\Pushover\Client([
    'token' => '',
]);
$pushover->message = 'testing';

// Push Single
$push = $pushover->push($token);

// Push Multiple
$push = $pushover->pushMultiple([
    $token1,
    $token2
]);
~~~

The only downside to pushover.net is that the [app](https://pushover.net/clients) costs, but with the amount of things I use it for, its been worth it.

If you wish to try out the library, then you can view it on [Github](https://github.com/scottrobertson/pushover).

Can't think of a use case? I built a quick CLI tool using the library to make it easy to push things to your mobile from your desktop. You can view that on [Github](https://github.com/scottrobertson/push) too.

If you do happen to use any of these, please let me know in the comments below.
